# Clean-and-Analyze-Social-Media-Usage
[Coursera Project Network] Conduct a Clean &amp; Analysis of Tweets using Python!
# Project Description

This project involves the analysis of engagement data related to different categories, such as Food, Travel, Fashion, Fitness, Music, Culture, Family, and Health. The project aims to generate random data, perform statistical analysis, and build a predictive model using logistic regression.

## Functions in the Project

### 1. `generate_random_data`: This function generates random data for a specified number of records and categories.

### 2. `display_dataframe_info`: It provides an overview of the input dataframe, displaying the first few rows and dataset information.

### 3. `visualize_category_engagement`: This function visualizes the average likes by category using bar plots.

### 4. `perform_anova_test`: It performs an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test on the likes for different categories.

### 5. `build_logistic_regression_model`: This function builds and evaluates a logistic regression model to predict engagement based on the number of likes.

### 6. `main`: The main function orchestrates the data generation, visualization, statistical testing, and model building processes.

The project utilizes popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-learn` to achieve its goals.

The functionality provided by this project can be useful for individuals or organizations looking to analyze engagement data in various categories and build predictive models based on the available data.

Feel free to explore the provided functions and customize them according to your specific requirements.
